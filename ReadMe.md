# Arduino Radar with Ultrasonic Sensor

This project demonstrates a simple radar system using an Arduino board, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor for controlling the movement of the sensor head. The radar system displays real-time distance measurements on a Processing IDE sketch, creating a virtual radar screen on your computer.

## Components Used
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Servo motor
- Jumper wires
- Computer with Processing IDE installed

## How It Works
1. The ultrasonic sensor emits a pulse and measures the time taken for the pulse to return after bouncing off an object.
2. The Arduino calculates the distance using the measured time and converts it into a format compatible with Processing IDE.
3. The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor head to cover a range of angles.
4. The Arduino sends distance data and angle information to the Processing sketch via the computer's serial port.
5. The Processing sketch receives this data and displays it on a radar-like screen, giving the appearance of a radar system.

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to the Arduino according to the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to the board.
3. Open the Processing sketch on your computer and ensure the serial port is correctly configured.
4. Run the Processing sketch to display the radar screen.
5. As the servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor head, the radar display will update in real-time.

## Usage and Customization
- Adjust the servo motor's rotation angles and speed in the Arduino code to fine-tune the scanning range and speed.
- Modify the Processing sketch to change the radar display appearance, such as colors and animations.

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced signal processing for better visualization.
- Add features like object detection and alarms for specific distance thresholds.
