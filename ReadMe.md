This project aims to leverage Arduino's capabilities to design a functional radar system capable of detecting objects in its vicinity. By implementing signal processing techniques and distance calculations, the radar will accurately identify objects and their distances. The acquired data will then be transmitted to a laptop where Processing will generate an intuitive graphical representation of the radar's output, enhancing user understanding. This project amalgamates hardware and software to showcase an efficient radar system with practical applications
